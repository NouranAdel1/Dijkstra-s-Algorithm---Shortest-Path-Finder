# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm---Shortest-Path-Finder

**Description:**
Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation is a Python script that calculates the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. It utilizes a graph data structure and the algorithm logic to find the shortest paths efficiently.

**Features:**
- **Graph Representation:** Utilizes an adjacency matrix to represent the graph.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given source node.
- **User Interaction:** Prompts the user to input the number of nodes, link costs, and the source node interactively.
- **Output Formatting:** Displays the shortest path cost and the path sequence for each node in the graph.

**Files:**
1. **dijkstra.py** - This file contains the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm:
    - Defines the `Graph` class with methods for graph initialization, Dijkstra's algorithm implementation, and utility functions for printing solutions.
    - Implements the `dijkstra` method to find the shortest paths from a given source node.
    - Provides a command-line interface for user interaction.

**Input Format:**
- Number of nodes: An integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (2 to 10).
- Link costs: For each pair of nodes, enter the cost of the link between them.
- Source node: Enter the index of the source node (0-indexed).

**Output Format:**
- For each node in the graph:
    - Vertex: Index of the node.
    - Shortest Path Cost: Cost of the shortest path from the source node.
    - Path: Sequence of nodes representing the shortest path from the source node.
